# SplineGame
Simple Path-Following using C and a Catmull-Rom Spline. I'll hopefully turn this into a game at some point, at the moment you can save/load files located in the EXE directory. Files are saved as spline.DAT, and are all saved in the same place. At some point, I will change this so the user uses a dialogue to save/load files.
